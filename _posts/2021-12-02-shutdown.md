It took different roles in the development of Shutdown:

## Audio Lead


## Audio Programmer

I’ve been in charge of the audio integration from our Audio Team, creating scripts that manage the sounds for the different objects in the scene like:

* Modifying all the scripts to integrate the audio logic into the object that emits sound. For instance, the sound for the abilities of all the players, enemies, and boss. It includes also all the objects from the scene like lasers, doors, fire, among others.
* **Audio Controller**: Manage all the music the game has, changing them between different situations like different levels, the pause menu, and the game over, keeping the values between scenes.
* **Audio Manager** for different channels. It includes the segregation between what is labeled as music and what is labeled as SFX.
* Add footstep functionality, using the keyframe event system from the Animation module, to reproduce each footstep when the animation is reaching the action.
* Outside the Audio department, helping to solve different problems inside the Gameplay scripting module.
